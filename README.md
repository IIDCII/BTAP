## 1. Inspiration
This project draws inspiration from the UK's **Sickle Cell Awareness Month**, a time dedicated to raising awareness about sickle cell disease (SCD) and improving treatment for those affected. Blood transfusions are a critical therapy for SCD patients, alleviating painful episodes and helping them live normalized lives. For example, [Tosin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ois9KVHLYf8), a patient documenting her battle with SCD on YouTube, describes the agonizing pain that comes with a sickle cell crisis and how regular blood transfusions are essential to her survival. Her story, and others like it, emphasizes the need for safe, precise transfusion systems. Research from [NHS Blood and Transplant](https://www.nhsbt.nhs.uk/how-you-can-help/get-involved/download-digital-materials/sickle-cell-awareness-2024/) highlights that the majority of SCD patients are of **African descent**, and many reside in rural and underfunded regions where access to specialized healthcare is limited. This provided the foundation for creating an AI system focused on **precise antigen matching** and predictive modeling to reduce complications and improve the quality of life for SCD patients. Additionally, studies from [Brigham and Women’s Hospital](https://sickle.bwh.harvard.edu/transfusion.html) emphasize the importance of tailored transfusion protocols to prevent complications like alloimmunization, which aligns with our system's objectives.

## 2. The Problem We're Solving
Sickle cell disease (SCD) predominantly affects **Black populations**, with over 80% of patients of African descent. Most of these patients live in **underfunded** and **rural areas**, where accessing specialized blood transfusion treatments is challenging. Blood transfusions are a vital treatment for managing painful crises and preventing life-threatening complications like stroke. As [Tosin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ois9KVHLYf8) details in her YouTube video, managing sickle cell disease is a constant battle that depends on timely and accurate blood transfusions. However, frequent transfusions come with risks, including **alloimmunization**, where the patient develops antibodies against donor blood due to mismatches in minor antigens like **Kell, Duffy, and Kidd**. Research from [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8252926/) and [Blood Journal](https://ashpublications.org/hematology/article/2021/1/689/482947/How-to-avoid-the-problem-of-erythrocyte) underscores how alloimmunization is a frequent complication in SCD patients. Our AI-driven system addresses this problem by using **extended antigen matching** and machine learning to predict alloimmunization risks, enabling hospitals in **resource-limited regions** to deliver safer and more effective transfusions.

## 3. Comparison with Other Blood Matching and Transfusion Systems
Existing blood transfusion systems focus predominantly on **ABO and RhD blood group matching**, which is insufficient for patients requiring frequent transfusions, such as those with SCD. In high-resource settings, systems may use molecular genotyping to prevent alloimmunization, but this is rarely available in **low-resource** or **rural areas** where the majority of SCD patients live. [Frontiers in Genetics](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/genetics/articles/10.3389/fgene.2022.1041462/full) and [Haem-Match](https://www.haemmatch.co.uk/blood-transfusion) show how molecular genotyping and advanced antigen matching dramatically improve transfusion outcomes. However, these systems often require expensive equipment and complex infrastructure, limiting their accessibility. Our system overcomes these limitations by offering **seamless integration with hospital databases** and supporting **AI-driven predictions** that enhance transfusion outcomes without needing advanced laboratory setups. Moreover, watching YouTubers like [Tosin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ois9KVHLYf8) share their experiences with transfusions highlights the critical need for affordable, scalable systems that work in rural and underserved communities. As research from [Haem-Match](https://www.haemmatch.co.uk/blood-transfusion) shows, systems that integrate extended matching protocols can dramatically reduce alloimmunization risks and improve patient outcomes, particularly in **rural and underfunded areas**.

## 4. Scalability and Future Development
Our AI system is built with scalability in mind, ensuring that hospitals can **easily integrate it** into their existing infrastructures, regardless of technological limitations. Through the creation of a **centralized data bank**, hospitals can contribute anonymized data to continuously improve the system’s predictive accuracy. Articles such as those from [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34283174/) and [Blood Advances](https://ashpublications.org/bloodadvances/article/7/24/7608/497844) stress the importance of secure and scalable data systems for improving transfusion practices globally. In the future, we plan to build upon this foundation by developing our own **AI model**, trained specifically on transfusion data provided by hospitals. This approach will allow us to further improve accuracy and tailor the system to the needs of **rural and underfunded hospitals**, as highlighted in research from [Blood Advances](https://ashpublications.org/bloodadvances/article/7/24/7608/497844). Unfortunately, during the hackathon, we were unable to source real-world data in time to train our model, but with the right **funding and partnerships**, we can leverage data from hospitals to build a **self-learning model** that adapts and improves as new information becomes available. Moreover, studies such as those from [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34283174/) demonstrate how centralized data can enhance treatment outcomes, especially when paired with robust security measures like **GDPR compliance**.

## 5. Summary
Our AI system offers a scalable, efficient, and cost-effective solution to the **complex problem of blood transfusion compatibility** for sickle cell patients, particularly those in **rural** or **underfunded regions**. By leveraging **extended antigen matching** and **AI-driven predictions**, we reduce the risk of alloimmunization and improve the overall quality of life for patients. The personal journeys shared by individuals like [Tosin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ois9KVHLYf8) emphasize the pressing need for solutions like ours, which are designed to provide reliable, safe transfusions even in areas with limited healthcare infrastructure. With continued development and funding, this system can become a **global solution** for transfusion management, addressing the needs of African and Black communities where sickle cell disease is most prevalent. As seen in studies from [Haem-Match](https://www.haemmatch.co.uk/blood-transfusion) and [Frontiers in Genetics](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/genetics/articles/10.3389/fgene.2022.1041462/full), advanced antigen matching systems dramatically improve patient outcomes, and our system is designed to bring this technology to areas where it is needed most.
